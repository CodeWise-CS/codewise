# CodeWise

CodeWise is a free platform to help people learn to program from a complete beginner to very advanced. The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of free, comprehensive, and engaging resources you can use to reach an expert level in a programming language, tool, etc.

## How it works

Once users create an account, they can explore our courses and career paths.

-   Courses, such as "HTML/CSS/JS" or "Python," are a list of alternating lessons with and quizzes. Lessons include several publicly available YouTube tutorials the user can watch, a code editor, and optional exercises to complete. Quizzes have multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions.
-   Career paths are a list of courses that the user can complete to learn about the important lanugages and tools in a field.
