# CodeWise

CodeWise is a free platform to help people learn to program from a complete beginner to very advanced. The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of free, comprehensive, and engaging resources you can use to reach an expert level in a programming language, tool, etc.

## How it works

Once users create an account, they can explore our courses and career paths.

-   Courses, such as "HTML/CSS/JS" or "Python," are a list of alternating lessons with and quizzes. Lessons include several publicly available YouTube tutorials the user can watch, a code editor, and optional exercises to complete. Quizzes have multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions.
-   Career paths are a list of courses that the user can complete to learn about the important lanugages and tools in a field.

## Contributing

CodeWise depends on the support of the community! There are two main ways you can contribute:

1. **The website:** in this repository, you can contribute to our website. This includes fixing bugs, adding features, improving UI, fixing safety issues, etc. You can follow the [contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more specific instructions.
2. **The curriculum:** [CodeWise's curriculum](https://github.com/CodeWise-CS/codewise-curriculum) is also open source, and we need your help for that too. That is where the information for our lessons (videos, exercises, quiz questions, etc.) is.
